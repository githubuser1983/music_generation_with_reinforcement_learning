# music_generation_with_reinforcement_learning
Music generation in OpenAI Gym with a custom state - and action space implementation for deep reinforcement learning. The dqn.ipynb script tries to learn to play the left hand of "For Elise". After training the files Qmodel-episode-nr-reward-is_random_initialised.mid are created if a new reward record is found.
